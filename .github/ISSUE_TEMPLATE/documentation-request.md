**Is something in the documentation unclear? Please describe.**
It could be about a function in the code. Ex. Function *atto_loop* in file `atto.h`:74 actually does something else than expected [...].

**Do you already know how to improve the points in the documentation?**
If you know, then suggest how you would describe it instead.

**What behavior did you actually expect?**
I am all in for making software more intuitive.
